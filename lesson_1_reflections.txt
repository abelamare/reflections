How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    by seeing the differnces between those two fiels line by line.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    when ever i want to get back to the old version i can do it easily and it helps me to trace any bug introduced.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    the pros are it lets us to decide when to commit which leads to better management of files and the cons are there
	could be some loss of data due user's negligence.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because git is specially designed to manage files which are related to each and to work on big projects.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    just to view the id s of the commits we use git log command and to see the history of that specific commit we use 
git diff first_id second_id  	

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    because it can be restored easily to the previous working version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    i wanna work on a sample project.
